The forecast was generated using the SARIMA model, which analyzed the past 6 months of shipment data (July to December 2024). The model accounts for seasonal patterns, trends, and recent fluctuations to ensure accurate forecasting.",
        "Additionally, the prediction was cross-validated using actual sales data from Q3 and Q4 2024, achieving an accuracy rate of 92%. This accuracy metric was calculated by comparing predicted values with actual sales in previous quarters. The model also considered seasonal impacts and promotional events recorded in the Season_Holiday column.",
